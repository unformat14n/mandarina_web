                            We are a team of passionate college students
                            currently on our junior/sophomore year of studying
                            BS in Software Engineering at Keiser University
                            Latin American Campus, San Marcos, Nicaragua. Our
                            team is composed of 4 students: Ximena Ruiz, Jordana
                            Puentes, Osvaldo Rodriguez and Kenneth Herrera. Each
                            of us has a unique skill set and we are all driven
                            by our desire to create applications, frameworks,
                            and other tools to help others in their daily lives
                            and solve problems in a way that can be attractive
                            and at the same time, effective.

                        <h3>What's Our Purpose?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our proyect has been through a lot of iterations and
                            changes. Since the beginning, we wanted to create a
                            task manager that would help people manage their
                            time and tasks in a more efficient way, mostly
                            focusing on studentsâ€“since we found ourselves in the
                            situation in which we were most affected by it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We are currently living in a world in which time
                            management is a very crucial skill to have. Thus, we
                            wanted to create a tool that would help people
                            manage their time and tasks efficiently and in a
                            simplified way, while also providing an interactive
                            and user-friendly interface making the process
                            enjoyable and fun.
